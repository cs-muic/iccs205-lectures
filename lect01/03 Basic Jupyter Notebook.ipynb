    "## Getting Started with Jupyter Notebook: Your Interactive Coding Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome\\! This lecture will introduce you to the Jupyter Notebook, an incredibly powerful tool for interactive computing. Think of it as a digital lab notebook where you can write and run code, see the results, add notes and explanations, and include visualizations all in one place.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Jupyter Notebook?\n",
    "\n",
    "A Jupyter Notebook is a web-based interactive environment that allows you to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and explanatory text. Its name is a nod to its support for three core programming languages: **Ju**lia, **Py**thon, and **R**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is it so popular?**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Interactive:** You can run small chunks of code one at a time and see the results immediately. This is great for exploring data and experimenting with ideas.\n",
    "  * **Literate Programming:** It encourages \"literate programming,\" where you explain your code and thought process alongside the code itself, making your work easy to understand and reproduce.\n",
    "  * **All-in-One:** It combines everything you need for a data science project—data loading, cleaning, modeling, visualization, and reporting—into a single document.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Jupyter Interface: The Dashboard\n",
    "\n",
    "When you first start Jupyter, you'll see the **Dashboard**. This is your main hub for managing your files and notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Files Tab:** This is your file browser. You can navigate through your folders here.\n",
    "  * **Running Tab:** Shows you which notebooks and terminals are currently active. It's a good practice to shut down notebooks from here when you're finished to save resources.\n",
    "  * **New Button:** This is how you create new items. To start, you'll click `New` and select `Python 3` (or your preferred kernel) to create a new notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### Anatomy of a Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you open a new notebook, you'll see three main parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Notebook Name:** Click on \"Untitled\" at the top to give your notebook a meaningful name.\n",
    "2.  **Menu Bar:** Contains standard options like File, Edit, View, etc., for managing your notebook.\n",
    "3.  **Toolbar:** Provides quick-access buttons for common actions like saving, adding cells, and running code.\n",
    "4.  **Cells:** These are the fundamental building blocks of a notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Core of Jupyter: Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "A notebook is essentially a sequence of cells. There are two primary types of cells you'll use constantly. You can switch a cell's type using the dropdown menu in the toolbar or with keyboard shortcuts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Code Cells**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where you write and execute your code. You'll see `In [ ]:` to the left, which indicates it's a code cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **To run a code cell**, simply click inside it and press **`Shift + Enter`**.\n",
    "  * The output of the code will appear directly below the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# In a code cell\n",
    "message = \"Hello, Jupyter!\"\n",
    "print(message)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Hello, Jupyter!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# In another code cell\n",
    "a = 15\n",
    "b = 20\n",
    "a + b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "35\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Markdown Cells**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where you write text, headings, lists, links, and even embed images to explain your work. Markdown is a simple way to format plain text.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To render a Markdown cell**, just run it like a code cell by pressing **`Shift + Enter`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Markdown Syntax:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "# This is a Main Heading\n",
    "\n",
    "## This is a Sub-heading\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a paragraph of text. You can make text **bold** or *italic*.\n",
    "\n",
    "A list of items:\n",
    "- First item\n",
    "- Second item\n",
    "- Third item\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also add links, like this one to [Google](https://www.google.com).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Kernel: The Engine of Your Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "The **kernel** is the computational engine that executes the code contained in a notebook. When you run a code cell, you are sending that code to the kernel, which runs it and sends the results back.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **State:** The kernel keeps track of all the variables, functions, and modules you've defined in memory. This means a variable defined in one cell is available in all subsequent cells.\n",
    "  * **Order Matters:** Because the kernel maintains state, the order in which you run your cells is important.\n",
    "  * **Managing the Kernel:** From the **Kernel** menu, you have several important options:\n",
    "      * **Restart:** Wipes all variables from memory and starts fresh. This is useful if your code gets stuck or you want a clean slate.\n",
    "      * **Restart & Clear Output:** Does the same as Restart but also erases all the output from your cells.\n",
    "      * **Restart & Run All:** Restarts the kernel and then runs all the cells in your notebook from top to bottom. **This is the best way to ensure your code is reproducible before sharing it.**\n",
    "      * **Interrupt:** Forcibly stops a code cell that is taking too long to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### Essential Keyboard Shortcuts\n",
    "\n",
    "Using keyboard shortcuts will dramatically speed up your workflow. Jupyter has two modes:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Edit Mode (Green Border):** You are typing inside a cell. Press **`Enter`** to enter this mode.\n",
    "  * **Command Mode (Blue Border):** You are operating on the notebook as a whole. Press **`Esc`** to enter this mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Shortcuts in Command Mode:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `A`: Insert a new cell **a**bove the current cell.\n",
    "  * `B`: Insert a new cell **b**elow the current cell.\n",
    "  * `M`: Change the current cell to **M**arkdown.\n",
    "  * `Y`: Change the current cell back to code.\n",
    "  * `D`, `D` (press twice): **D**elete the current cell.\n",
    "  * `Z`: Undo the last cell deletion.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Universal Shortcut:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `Shift + Enter`: Run the current cell and move to the next one.\n",
    "  * `Ctrl + Enter`: Run the current cell and stay on that cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### Saving and Exporting Your Work\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter autosaves your work every few minutes in a `.ipynb` file. However, you should always save manually (**`Ctrl + S`** or the floppy disk icon) before closing.\n",
    "\n",
    "To share your notebook with others, especially those who don't have Jupyter installed, you can export it in different formats via **`File -> Download as...`**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **HTML:** A static web page view of your notebook. Excellent for sharing reports.\n",
    "  * **PDF:** A PDF version (requires a LaTeX installation).\n",
    "  * **Python (.py):** A plain Python script with all the code from your notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary and Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Tell a Story:** Use Markdown cells to explain your methodology, assumptions, and conclusions. Your notebook should be readable from top to bottom.\n",
    "2.  **Keep Cells Small:** Break your code into small, logical steps. This makes debugging easier.\n",
    "3.  **Name Variables Clearly:** Use descriptive names for your variables (e.g., `student_names` instead of `x`).\n",
    "4.  **Restart and Run All:** Before finishing, always restart the kernel and run all cells to ensure your results are reproducible and not dependent on an old execution order.\n",
    "5.  **Use Shortcuts:** Learn the keyboard shortcuts to become a more efficient Jupyter user.\n"
