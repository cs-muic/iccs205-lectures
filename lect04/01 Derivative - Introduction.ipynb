        "\n",
        "A **numerical derivative** is an approximation of the derivative of a function using discrete data points rather than analytical calculus. While analytical derivatives give us exact mathematical expressions, numerical derivatives allow us to:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Estimate derivatives when we only have data points** (not a mathematical formula)\n",
        "- **Compute derivatives of complex functions** that are difficult to differentiate analytically\n",
        "- **Handle experimental or measured data** where we don't have an underlying equation\n",
        "- **Implement derivatives in computer programs** for numerical methods and simulations\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why Do We Need Numerical Derivatives?\n",
        "\n",
        "In many real-world scenarios, we encounter situations where analytical differentiation is not practical or possible:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Experimental Data**: When analyzing experimental measurements, we often only have discrete data points\n",
        "2. **Complex Functions**: Some functions are too complicated to differentiate by hand\n",
        "3. **Black Box Functions**: Sometimes we can evaluate a function but don't know its analytical form\n",
        "4. **Computational Efficiency**: In some cases, numerical approximation can be faster than computing complex analytical derivatives\n",
        "\n",
        "## The Basic Idea\n",
        "\n",
        "The fundamental concept behind numerical derivatives comes from the **definition of a derivative**. Instead of taking the limit as h approaches zero, we use a small but finite value of h to approximate the derivative:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\\text{Analytical: } f'(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$$\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\\text{Numerical: } f'(x) \\approx \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h} \\text{ for small } h$$\n",

        "## Trade-offs and Considerations\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Accuracy vs. Step Size**: Smaller h generally gives better approximation, but too small h can lead to numerical errors\n",
        "- **Computational Cost**: More accurate methods require more function evaluations\n",
        "- **Stability**: Some methods are more robust to numerical errors than others\n",
