    "### Convergence\n",
    "\n",
    "Convergence is the heart of iterative methods. It describes how quickly and reliably a sequence of approximations, let's call them $x_n$, approaches the true root, $\\alpha$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We measure convergence in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Order of Convergence**: This tells us the *speed* of convergence. If $e_n = |x_n - \\alpha|$ is the error at iteration $n$, the order of convergence $p$ is given by:\n",
    "    $$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{|e_{n+1}|}{|e_n|^p} = \\lambda$$\n",
    "    where $\\lambda$ is a constant.\n",
    "    * If $p=1$, we have **linear convergence**. The error is reduced by a roughly constant factor at each step. (Slow üê¢)\n",
    "    * If $p=2$, we have **quadratic convergence**. The number of correct decimal places roughly doubles with each iteration. (Fast üöÄ)\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Guaranteed Convergence**: This tells us if the method is *guaranteed* to find a root under certain conditions. Some methods are robust and always work if you start them correctly, while others can fail spectacularly.\n",
