    "### Python Installation on Windows\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1\\. Official Python Installer\n",
    "\n",
    "The most direct way to install Python on Windows is by using the official installer from the Python website.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Download**: Go to the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/). Download the latest stable version (e.g., Python 3.12.x). Choose the \"Windows installer (64-bit)\".\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Installation**: Run the downloaded `.exe` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "      * **Crucial Step**: On the first screen of the installer, make sure to check the box that says **\"Add python.exe to PATH\"**. This allows you to run Python from the command line (Command Prompt or PowerShell) from any directory.\n",
    "      * Select \"Install Now\" for the recommended installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Verification**: To confirm the installation was successful, open your Command Prompt (search for `cmd`) and type:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    python --version\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    You should see the Python version you just installed. You can also check for `pip`, Python's package installer:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    pip --version\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2\\. Virtual Environments: `venv`\n",
    "\n",
    "A **virtual environment** is an isolated Python environment that allows you to manage dependencies for a specific project separately from other projects. This prevents package version conflicts. Python's built-in module for this is `venv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Create a Project Folder**: First, create a folder for your course projects.\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    mkdir numerical-methods\n",
    "    cd numerical-methods\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "2.  **Create a Virtual Environment**: Inside your project folder, run the following command to create a virtual environment named `env`:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    python -m venv env\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    This creates a new folder named `env` containing a copy of the Python interpreter and its standard libraries.\n",
    "3.  **Activate the Environment**: To start using the environment, you need to activate it.\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    .\\env\\Scripts\\activate\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Your command prompt will now be prefixed with `(env)`, indicating that the virtual environment is active. Any packages you install now will be placed in this `env` folder and isolated from your global Python installation.\n",
    "4.  **Deactivate**: When you're done working, simply type:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    deactivate\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3\\. Poetry: Modern Project & Dependency Management\n",
    "\n",
    "**Poetry** is a fantastic tool that simplifies dependency management and project packaging. It handles virtual environments for you automatically and uses a clear `pyproject.toml` file to manage your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Install Poetry**: The recommended way to install Poetry on Windows is through PowerShell. Open PowerShell and run:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://install.python-poetry.org -UseBasicParsing).Content | python -\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    You may need to restart your terminal for the changes to take effect.\n",
    "2.  **Start a New Project**: Navigate to where you want to create your project and run:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    poetry new my-numerical-project\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    This creates a new folder with a standard project structure.\n",
    "3.  **Add Dependencies**: Move into your new project directory (`cd my-numerical-project`). To add libraries like NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib, which are essential for numerical methods, use the `poetry add` command:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    poetry add numpy scipy matplotlib\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Poetry automatically creates a virtual environment for the project and installs these packages.\n",
    "4.  **Run Your Code**: To run a script within the Poetry-managed environment, use `poetry run`:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    poetry run python your_script.py\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4\\. Anaconda Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "**Anaconda** is a free and open-source distribution of Python and R specifically for scientific computing and data science. It simplifies package management and deployment. Its key advantage is that it comes pre-loaded with hundreds of popular data science packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Download**: Go to the [Anaconda Distribution download page](https://www.anaconda.com/download) and get the installer for Windows.\n",
    "  * **Installation**: Run the installer. It's a standard installation wizard. The recommended setting is to install for \"Just Me\". The installer will also ask if you want to add Anaconda to your PATH environment variable. The installer recommends against this to avoid conflicts with other Python installations, which is generally good advice. Instead, you'll use the **Anaconda Prompt**.\n",
    "  * **Using Anaconda**: After installation, search for and open the **Anaconda Prompt** from your Start Menu. This is a command prompt that is already configured to use Anaconda's Python and its package manager, **conda**.\n",
    "  * **Managing Environments with Conda**: `conda` is Anaconda's powerful package and environment manager.\n",
    "      * **Create an environment**:\n",
    "        ```bash\n",
    "        conda create --name nm-env python=3.11 numpy scipy matplotlib jupyterlab\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "        This command creates a new environment named `nm-env` with Python 3.11 and some essential packages.\n",
    "      * **Activate the environment**:\n",
    "        ```bash\n",
    "        conda activate nm-env\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "      * **Deactivate the environment**:\n",
    "        ```bash\n",
    "        conda deactivate\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Installation on macOS\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting up Python on macOS is very similar to Windows. macOS comes with a pre-installed version of Python, but it's often outdated. It's highly recommended to install a modern version.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Official Installer**: Download the macOS installer from the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/). Run the downloaded `.pkg` file and follow the installation wizard. This will install Python in your `/Applications` folder and create symbolic links in `/usr/local/bin/`.\n",
    "2.  **Homebrew**: A more popular method among developers is using the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) package manager.\n",
    "      * **Install Homebrew** (if you don't have it): Open your Terminal and run:\n",
    "        ```bash\n",
    "        /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "      * **Install Python**:\n",
    "        ```bash\n",
    "        brew install python3\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "3.  **`venv` and Poetry**: The commands for `venv` and Poetry are nearly identical to Windows, with a small change for `venv` activation.\n",
    "      * **Activate `venv` on macOS/Linux**:\n",
    "        ```bash\n",
    "        source env/bin/activate\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "4.  **Anaconda**: The installation process is the same. Download the `.pkg` installer for macOS from the [Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/download) and follow the instructions. You will then use the Terminal, which will be configured by the installer to use `conda`.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interactive Environments: Jupyter & Colab\n",
    "\n",
    "For numerical methods, we often want to experiment with code, visualize data, and see results instantly. This is where interactive environments shine.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Jupyter Notebook** is a web-based interactive computing environment that allows you to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It's an incredibly powerful tool for scientific computing and data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **How it works**: A notebook is organized into **cells**. You can have code cells (for Python) and text cells (using Markdown for formatting). You can execute code cells one by one and see the output immediately below the cell. This makes it perfect for exploratory work.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Installation**: If you used Anaconda, Jupyter is likely already installed. If not, you can install it with `pip`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    pip install notebook\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    If you're using Poetry, add it to your project:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    poetry add notebook\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Running Jupyter**: Navigate to your project folder in the terminal (and activate your virtual environment if you're not using Poetry or conda) and run:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    jupyter notebook\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    This will start a local server and open a new tab in your web browser, showing a file browser for your project directory. From there, you can create a new notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Google Colaboratory (Colab)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Google Colab** is essentially a free, cloud-based version of Jupyter Notebook that runs entirely in your browser. It requires **zero installation** and provides access to powerful hardware, including **free GPUs and TPUs**, which can be extremely useful for more computationally intensive tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Key Advantages**:\n",
    "      * **No Setup Required**: All you need is a Google account and a web browser.\n",
    "      * **Free GPU/TPU Access**: Excellent for machine learning and deep learning tasks.\n",
    "      * **Easy Collaboration**: Notebooks are saved to your Google Drive and can be shared and edited collaboratively, just like Google Docs.\n",
    "      * **Pre-installed Libraries**: Most common data science libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, etc.) are already installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, simply go to [colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com). You can create a new notebook and start coding immediately. It's a fantastic option for this course if you want to avoid local installation hassles."
